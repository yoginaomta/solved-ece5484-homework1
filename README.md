</ol>

<ol start="6">

 <li>Suppose a computer uses radix-3 (ternary) logic instead of radix-2 (binary) logic to represent unsigned integers.

  <ol>

   <li>What is the radix-3 representation of the decimal value 37?</li>

   <li>What is the largest value that can be represented by 6 digits?</li>

   <li>Why do you think that binary logic is much more commonly used than ternary logic? Be brief.</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>Convert the hexadecimal number FEED A BEE to binary.</li>

 <li>Represent each of the following decimal numbers in binary using 8-bit signed magnitude, one’s complement, two’s complement, and excess-127 representations:

  <ol>

   <li>35</li>

   <li>-35</li>

   <li>97</li>

   <li>-97</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>If the floating-point number representation on a certain system has a sign bit, a 4-bit exponent and a 5-bit significand:

  <ol>

   <li>What is the largest positive and the smallest positive number that can be stored on this system if the storage is normalized? (Assume no bits are implied, there is no biasing, exponents use two’s complement notation, and exponents of all zeros and all ones are allowed.)</li>

   <li>What bias should be used in the exponent if we prefer all exponents to be non-negative? Why would you choose this bias?</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>Answer the following questions about character encoding.

  <ol start="1100101">

   <li>The ASCII code for the letter E is 1000101, and the ASCII code for the letter e is 1100101. Given that the ASCII code for the letter M is 1001101, without looking at Table 2.7, what is the ASCII code for the letter m?</li>

   <li>The EBCDIC code for the letter E is 11000101, and the EBCDIC code for the letter e is 1000 0101. Given that the EBCDIC code for the letter M is 1101 0100, without looking at Table 2.7, what is the EBCDIC code for the letter m?</li>
